# Study the Impact of Contextual Factors on the Achievement of the Targets of SDG 3

## BACKGROUND

Goal 3 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) focuses on ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages. Within this goal, we find indicators SDG 3.4.2 and SDG 3.8.1. Indicator SDG 3.4.2, related to suicide mortality, is a serious public health issue affecting people of all ages and countries. This indicator aims to prevent and reduce suicide rates, promote mental health, and psychological well-being. On the other hand, SDG 3.8.1 focuses on ensuring that everyone has access to ssential health services. This entails ensuring that individuals can receive quality medical care, including preventive services, diagnosis, treatment, and disease care. Currently, numerous actions are being taken worldwide to advance towards the achievement of SDG 3 targets. The implementation and development of these actions require the involvement of multiple stakeholders, including governments, the private sector, civil society, non-governmental organizations, academic institutions, and local communities. Partnerships and alliances are being encouraged to promote collaboration and coordination in their implementation. Additionally, scientific research, the development of sustainable technological solutions, and the exchange of knowledge and best practices on a global scale are being promoted.

It is in this context that, under the current collaboration agreement between the University of Costa Rica and the Pan American Health Organization, we propose to develop a predictive analysis framework aimed at examining the impact of political, social, environmental, and demographic factors on the achievement of the targets set for SDG 3.4.2 and SDG 3.8.1 indicators of SDG 3 by the year 2030.

Predictive analysis will help identify possible future scenarios and key factors that may affect the achievement of these targets. This will provide a solid foundation for making informed decisions, designing effective strategies, and allocating resources appropriately to advance towards the achievement of SDG 3 related to health and well-being.

To assess progress towards SDG 3 targets, a monitoring and tracking mechanism has been established, involving the collection of relevant data, indicators, and statistics, as well as the periodic analysis of progress and challenges. Monitoring allows us to identify areas that require greater attention and adjust policies and actions accordingly. For the development of our analyses and scenarios, we will rely on existing data that has been collected for this purpose.

## OBJECTIVES
Develop a predictive analysis framework to assess, through different scenarios, the impact of political, social, environmental, and demographic factors on the achievement of the targets set for indicators 3.4.2 and 3.8.1 of SDG 3 by the year 2030.

### Specific Objectives:

1. Identify the factors influencing the temporal and spatial dynamics of indicators SDG 3.4.2 and SDG 3.8.1 through statistical analysis.
2. Develop a statistical model to project the trajectory of indicators SDG 3.4.2 and SDG 3.8.1, taking into account the effects of social, environmental, and demographic variables.
3. Propose hypothetical scenarios through which the effects of certain social, environmental, and demographic variables on the expected trajectory of the indicators can be simulated."
